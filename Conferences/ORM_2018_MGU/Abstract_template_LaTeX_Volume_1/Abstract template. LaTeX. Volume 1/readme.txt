This is the readme file for the template of ORM 2018 proceedings. Please read these instructions carefully before starting to prepare your abstract.

Insert your extended abstract into the file your_abstract.tex following the directions therein. Use the file main.tex for compilation and checking the result.

Do not add anything to the file main.tex. Submit to the organizers the file your_abstract.tex only. If you will submit main.tex with your modifications, it will be ignored. If you really cannot avoid inserting your own definitions before \begin{document}, please discuss this issue with the organizers.

If you are making references by labels, please remember that your abstract will be combined with those by other participants. Hence, think of selecting such labels that 
will remain unique after your abstract will be put together with the others' (e.g., include your names in each label).

You may include figures in eps format, in which case do not forget to submit the eps file(s) as well. If you want to compile directly to pdf, please do the following in order to achieve correct appearance of your figures: in main.tex, comment out the command \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} in line 12, and uncomment the commands \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
 and \usepackage{epstopdf} in lines 13 and 14, respectively. This will allows LatTeX to automatically convert your eps files to pdf. There is no need to submit pdf files of your figures.
